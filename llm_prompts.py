Sixty adult patients, ASA Classes I & II, were involved in a study to compare the effectiveness of Mallinckrodt Hi-Lo-Evac tube and Portex blue line tube in preventing soiling of the lower airways during intranasal surgery. The Hi-Lo-Evac tube with and without pack was significantly more effective than the Portex tube with pharyngeal pack (P less than 0.002) and (P less than 0.01 respectively). There was no significant difference when the Hi-Lo-Evac tube was used with or without a pack (P greater than 0.2). The more effective protection of the lower airways by the Hi-Lo-Evac tube is attributed to the facility of subglottic aspiration during surgery. It is suggested that the Hi-Lo-Evac tube could be used with safety during intranasal surgery in order to reduce postoperative morbidity associated with the use of pharyngeal pack."

Abstract: "The effect of values affirmation on race-discordant patient-provider communication. BACKGROUND Communication between African American patients and white health care providers has been shown to be of poorer quality when compared with race-concordant patient-provider communication. Fear on the part of patients that providers stereotype them negatively might be one cause of this poorer communication. This stereotype threat may be lessened by a values-affirmation intervention. METHODS In a blinded experiment, we randomized 99 African American patients with hypertension to perform a values-affirmation exercise or a control exercise before a visit with their primary care provider. We compared patient-provider communication for the 2 groups using audio recordings of the visit analyzed with the Roter Interaction Analysis System. We also evaluated visit satisfaction, trust, stress, and mood after the visit by means of a questionnaire. RESULTS Patients in the intervention group requested and provided more information about their medical condition (mean SE number of utterances, 66.3 6.8 in the values-affirmation group vs 48.1 5.9 in the control group P = .03). Patient-provider communication in the intervention group was characterized as being more interested, friendly, responsive, interactive, and respectful (P = .02) and less depressed and distressed (P = .03). Patient questionnaires did not detect differences in visit satisfaction, trust, stress, or mood. Mean visit duration did not differ significantly between the groups (19.2 minutes in the control group vs 20.5 minutes in the intervention group P = .29). CONCLUSIONS A values-affirmation exercise improves aspects of patient-provider communication in race-discordant primary care visits. The clinical impact of the intervention must be defined before widespread implementation can be recommended."

Two fixed ratio combination tablets, 10 mg pindolol combined with 5 mg clopamide and 100 mg metoprolol combined with 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide, were compared at two dose levels in a double-blind crossover trial in 10 previously untreated hypertensive patients. No significant difference was observed between resting blood pressure on the two combinations at either dose level. Exercise systolic pressure was lower after the pindolol/clopamide combination at low dose (p less than 0.05). The incidence of side-effects in this trial was high but proper comparison of the two products could not be made because of the small number of patients. It is suggested that combination products should be used only after patients have failed to respond adequately to a single agent."
